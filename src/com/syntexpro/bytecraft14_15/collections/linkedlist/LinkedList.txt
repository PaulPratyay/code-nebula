                    >>LinkedList<<

-> Java LinkedList class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements;
-> It provides a linked-list data structure;
-> It inherits the AbstractList Class and implements List and Deque interfaces;

            **Important points about Java LinkedList**

=> Java LinkedList class can contain duplicate elements;
=> Java LinkedList class maintains insertion order;
=> Java LinkedList class is non synchronized;
=> In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to occur ;
=> Java LinkedList class can be used as a list, stack or queue;

-> Works same as ArrayList;
-> In memory, it is stored node wise;
-> It checks every node to find out the value;
-> Nodes are connected as chains;
-> When we add/remove data, it will just connect its chain to the corresponding chain;
-> LinkedList is faster and good for adding/removing data;
